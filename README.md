# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

Basic program to generate a dynamic webpage based on the code learnt in the course.
There are 4 films, generally regarded as classics in the world of cinema:
	Toy Story, Emoji Movie, The Godfather, Lord of the Rings.

To begin, run entertainment_center.py. You can do this is in GitBash by opening the directory (after downloading it from GitHub) and
typing "python entertainment_centre.py".

The script will then open a new tab in your web browser which will display the desired output, a web page will links to movie trailers.

Thanks,
